Hi.

Maybe there is not yet so much I can say about my life, but there are so many ways. I can craft a story a million times until the core is smooth, the form lucid, and the presentation, fragrant. That's what I can do with my sheer hands and mind. However, more and more, I'm realizing that I am not the only one who construct the narratives. Beyond me there is no god (as far as I am concerned), but version control: an honest reflection of things that might not be deemed valuable at the time, but, once kept, start to shine.

The site is two-folded:

**The first:** I produce proses, poems, thought. I write them down. They are from my conscious mind, even when I am drunk. Sometimes I create forms to present them, of which I have no idea when I start. Like plots, they only emerge as I continue to live with my characters. The medium is something that I am still discovering, something flat, dark and requires both intelligence and diligence to get fluent at, just like I would with watercolor or clay, something called the web.

**The second:** The glimpse of a thought, of something intangible, passing, neglected, yet recorded with precision, timestamped and revertible. How come I would write something that said `translation is a time-based mechanism` for a commit message I could not remember. It was a fleeting second, but in the silence of the night respects were paid by delivering something into the space. A space that does not respond or consume, but takes, patiently, every little word you sacrifice.
