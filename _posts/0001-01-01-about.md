> Which yellow bird

> -Pablo Neruda, _The Book of Questions_

I work at a place where I'm currently building a bike in the garage over the weekends. During the weekdays I design maps and websites. This little site houses some of my work, poems and thoughts.

Why good lemons? It goes back to the first time when I heard of the phrase _get lemon_. I was in a bike shop. I asked them if they sold used bikes. "No, we don't. Most of the time you'd get lemon." I smiled at him and said, REALLY? I was happy that, finally, someone had associated lemon with bikes - the bright fruit and the brilliant machine. The guy looked at me with puzzlement. After I got out the shop I asked my friend what it meant to get lemon. He told me...ah well.

Getting lemon is never a bad thing for me. I cook with them, put them in tea, [preserve them](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Preserved-Lemons-231570). Once I visited my friend who had a small lemon tree. It only bore one fruit each year, which we made into a [whole lemon tart](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/02/whole-lemon-tart/), probably the most wholesome way to celebrate its conception and growth.

When I think of lemons, I think of palpable form and luminous flavor.
