I work at a place where I'm currently building a bike in the garage over the weekends. During the weekdays I design maps and websites.

The first time I heard of the phrase "get lemon" I was in a bike shop. I asked them if they sold used bikes. "No, we don't. Most of the time you'd get lemon." I smiled at him and said, REALLY? I was happy that, finally, someone associated lemons with bikes - the bright fruit and the brilliant machine. The guy looked at me with puzzlement. After I got out the shop I asked my friend what it meant to get lemon. He told me...Ah well.
    
Why is getting lemon a bad thing? I usually keep a few lemons around even if I don't have immediate use for them. They are of a luminous kind. This is a little site where I post some work, poems and drawings - thoughts in general, amongst a few practices. All good lemons that make the tea sweet and the summer breezy. Not fancy but content.
