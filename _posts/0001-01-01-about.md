> Which yellow bird  
> fills its nest with lemons?
>
> -Pablo Neruda, _The Book of Questions_

<p>I work at <a href='http://www.mapbox.com/' target='_blank'>a place</a> where <strike>I'm currently building</strike> I have built a bike in the garage over the weekends. During the weekdays I design maps and websites. This little site houses some of my work, poems and thoughts.</p>

Why good lemons? It goes back to the first time when I heard of the phrase _get lemon_. I was in a bike shop. I asked the guy if they sold used bikes. "No, we don't. Most of the time you'd get lemon." I smiled at him and said, REALLY? I was happy that, finally, someone had associated lemon with bikes - the bright fruit and the brilliant machine. The guy looked at me with puzzlement.

Getting lemon is never a bad thing for me. I cook with them, put them in tea, [preserve them](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Preserved-Lemons-231570). Once I visited my friend who had planted a small lemon tree in a pot. It only bore one fruit each year. That year we used it in a [whole lemon tart](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/02/whole-lemon-tart/).

Later I thought, such palpable form and luminous flavor. Such conception and growth.
