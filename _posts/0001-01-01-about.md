> Which yellow bird  
> fills its nest with lemons?
>
> -Pablo Neruda, _The Book of Questions_


I work at a place where I'm currently building a bike in the garage over the weekends. During the weekdays I design maps and websites. This little site houses some of my work, poems and thoughts, all of which are good lemons that make tea sweet and summer breezy.

The first time I heard of the phrase _get lemon_ I was in a bike shop. I asked them if they sold used bikes. "No, we don't. Most of the time you'd get lemon." I smiled at him and said, REALLY? I was happy that, finally, someone had associated lemon with bikes - the bright fruit and the brilliant machine. The guy looked at me with puzzlement. After I got out the shop I asked my friend what it meant to get lemon. He told me...Ah well.

Why is getting lemon a bad thing? I usually keep a few lemons around even if I don't have immediate use for them. Applaud for the palpable form and luminous flavor.
