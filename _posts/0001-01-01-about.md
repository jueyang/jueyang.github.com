> Which yellow bird

> fills its nest with lemons?

> Pablo Neruda, _The Book of Questions_

During the weekdays I design maps and websites. This little site houses some of my work, poems and thoughts.

Why good lemons? It goes back to the first time when I heard of the phrase "get lemons". I was in a bike shop. I asked the guy if they sold used bikes. "No, we don't. Most of the time you'd get lemons." I smiled with the loud exclamation, "really?" I was happy that, finally, someone was associating lemon with bikes - the bright fruit and the brilliant machine. The guy looked at me with puzzlement.

Getting lemon is never a bad thing for me. Once I visited my friend who had a small potted lemon tree. It only bore one fruit each year. That year we used it in a [whole lemon tart](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/02/whole-lemon-tart/).

Later I thought, such palpable form & luminous flavor. Such conception & growth.
