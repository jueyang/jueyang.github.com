I look out of the window: slate roofs, snow

Patches of pale green and paler pink

***

Pigments the old man once chose 

to paint the lotus flowers 

on white silk

***

When the paint dried

he raised the scissors and followed 

the imagined contour of a body

***

He was tailoring a gown

that now sits in my suitcase 

two thousand miles above the ground

***

"Are you getting married?" 

He asked with a tape measure around my waist

"No, I am just going away."
