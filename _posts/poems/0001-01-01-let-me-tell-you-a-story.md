I lived with a lizard named Hank â€” a Geico, I mean, sorry, a gecco. Once someone misnamed Hank, Gary. Unfazed, I still called him Hank. One day, as Hank tanned under the heat lamp, I looked through his skull. Right through his translucent skull. He had no brain in it. Hank was trampling on his plant. It was a nice plant. Hank killed it. Hank killed his nice plant, not knowing that he had killed his nice plant. That's what I wanted to tell you. Look, my jellyfish just died. It used to remind me of Gary. My jellyfish had no brain, either. Now it reminds me of Hank.
