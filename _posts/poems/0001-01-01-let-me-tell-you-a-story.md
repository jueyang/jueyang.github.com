I lived with a lizard named Hank â€” a Geico, I mean, sorry, a gecco. Once someone misnamed Hank, Gary. One day, as he tanned under the heat lamp, I looked through his skull. Translucent, brainless, airy. He was trampling on his plant. It was a nice plant. He was killing his nice plant, not knowing that he was killing his nice plant. That's what I wanted to tell you. Look, my jellyfish just died. My jellyfish had no brain, either. I don't know why I tell you this. Out of the stubbornness of hands. Out of the absence of mind. Out of a question, maybe.
