Let me tell you a story:

***

I lived with a lizard named Hank

A Geico, I mean, sorry, a gecco

***

Once someone misnamed Hank Gary

but we called him Hank regardless

***

The day Hank was tanning under his heat lamp

I looked right through his brain

He had nothing in the skull

***

He was trampling on his plant

a nice plant, but he killed it

All this is inspired by a dead jelly fish

- This is what their brain looks like. dot dot dot dot.
- Yeah, this jellyfish reminds me of Chris.
