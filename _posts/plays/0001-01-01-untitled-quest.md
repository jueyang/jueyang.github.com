	<h1>You will read a play.</h1>
	<p>Right now it only lives on the screen. You see the words, comprehend the words, imagine the words turning into an environment, a darkness, a sweetness, a state of confusion. Or you let them stand in their lankiness against the blaring white. It's a play on p-a-p-e-r, even though there is no actual paper involved in this. But you get the idea: you engage with it as you would with an article. You can turn around, go for a run, get groceries, and encounter this again on your own terms, say as you sit down and eat a bowl of cereal. There are no rules.</p>
	<p>What you see is a moment in time, a very small window of something frozen. Then it thaws and evaporates and freezes some more, but it never comes back to you in the same shape. The changes are derived from freedom, that of <em>transience</em> -- for this play has not been produced, and thus bearing very few responsibilities; of <em>solitude</em> -- for there is not yet a team nor fellow audience, hence no exchange of interpretations of the work; of being <em>unknown</em> -- for it is uncertain that you exist.</p>
	<h1>Do you exist?</h1>
	<p>Yet it's a freedom that yearns for a framework. It needs a more concrete and precise execution of itself. I am doing what I can -- sifting through my words and process, passing them back and forth from one end of the table to the other, placing them between the fork and the knife, the rock and the hard place. One day I might know the exact way to be and, <em>for it to be</em>.  You can be in this with me. It's a struggle, the kind that makes you smile out of resilience as you tramp on the snow-covered path.</p>
	<p>Have you read <em>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</em> by Italo Calvino? There's no urgency to finish, I know. I relate to that piece of work. Its form in which words mold uncertain meanings, its structure in which context are intellectualized with piercing observation at times and read with trembling fervor at others. The depth created on the two-dimentional p-a-p-e-r where the kernel of truth easily becomes the seed of fantasy, and the narrative that comes first does not really matter anymore. Texts can manifest as music, concrete poetry, or serve a communicative function. Dialogues can be autobiographical, fictional, read, or performed. God can be the 12-year-old next door, an ensemble of wise dogs, an anthromorphized belief like a piece of googly-eyed old news, a circular thought whose beginning and ending are but semantics that no longer exist.</p>

	<p>When I wanted to be an <a href='http://oldwork.tumblr.com' target='_blank'>architect</a> a few years ago, I was told -- by my mentors, by the books, by the idols I had at the time -- to LIVE, and do so with tremedous humility. I perceived the architect as the very profession of altruism...empathy. You are making space for other people -- to live in, to study in, to get a piece of quiet mind in...It's a bit idealized, I know, but that's what I believed.</p>
	<p class="direction">(finds it profound, yet funny)</p>
	<p>So I lived. I lived and lived and now I have empathized with computers.</p>

<div class="character">Playwright</div>
<div class="dialogue">
	<p>That's what <em>time</em> did to me. <a href="/portfolio" target="_blank">I made websites, constructed information architecture, geo-located ideas and patterns</a>. I let the unforeseen opportunities shape my trajectory. I didn't want to preordain my experiences just because I studied this or that. I trusted spontaneity. I did become humbled by...technology. But spontaneity led to a routine. I did more of the same thing. More and more and more until nothing was tangible but the keyboard, nothing was visible but the glowing screen. I kept going because I believed whatever knowledge I gained -- however irrelavant they seemed -- would add up to something. SOMETHING.</p>
	<p class="direction">(realizes)</p>
	<p>And it led to this: I've refused to call myself an artist.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
	<p>An artist can be as selfless or narcissistic as she wants to. She can collaborate with as many or as few people, and have as much or as little social impact. She can certainly understand the, "real", world -- probably deeper than a lot of people. An artist can figure out ways to stay afloat... More than afloat. Sure, it might not be easy and might take more time than other paths. But an artist <em>does</em> because she <em>must</em>.</p>

	<p>It's the desire to dedicate myself while I am doing -- have been doing something totally different. This pursuit of something pure, the craft of that something pure, it's far and daunting and I don't know what is the right thing to do. I don't know how to be in two realities at the same time.</p>

	<p class="direction">(finds the sketchbook she was looking for, pulls it out from the bookshelf and flips to a page)</p>
	<p>I had this epiphany once. I was at an architecture critique. One of my studio mates was presenting, but I couldn't process what he was talking about. My brain was filled with words and images and sketches... I was deep, deep in thought, and all of a sudden -- beyond the control of my consciousness -- they started to zoom out, like a camera that was very close started to pull away. Away and away until all those letters and drawings became a square. One. Single. Square. Dense with information. Yet unintelligible. The camera moved on to a different block of words and images, close up at first, and the same thing happened -- away...away...and away! </p>
	<p class="direction">(points to a place on the page)</p>
	<p>I ended up with all these neatly organized squares. It was the <em>definition</em> of synthesis. I remember thinking, is this what abstraction is? Is this how my brain organizes chaos? Is this, actually, how the human mind works???</p>
	<p class="direction">(more calmly)</p>
	<p>I thought by living -- by learning things that I would not have dreamed of being capable of -- I would endure the chaos and reach that level of clarity again, with even more materials.</p>

	<p>Have you?</p>
</div>
<div class="character">Playwright</div>
<div class="dialogue">
	<p>The first time I organized a bunch of code into objects -- this programming paradigm -- I had a flashback of <em>just that</em>: the camera zooming out. The synthesis. Later I learned more vocabularies in programming: functions, patterns, modules... I have finally found the precise words to describe that moment of epiphany. My metaphors expanded: data structure, building structure; binding data to a node, associating meaning with a name. I was able to understand both worlds. And I was able to decode and encrypt at the same time. It felt as though I was learning a new language and doing standup in it. And People laugh because I have the wit, the real deal, even though it's not my mother tongue.</p>
