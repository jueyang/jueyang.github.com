    <p>The first time I heard of the phrase "get lemons" I was in a bike shop. The guy showed me a fuji and said something about used bikes. "Sometimes you get lemon." I smiled at him and said, really? I was pretty happy that someone associated lemons with bikes. After I got out the shop I asked my friend what it meant. He told me...Ah well.</p>
    <p>This is a little site where I post some thoughts at work and a few poems. I think they are all good lemons that make good tea and summer.</p>
