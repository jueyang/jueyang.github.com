I will be reading a few poems written in the past six weeks at _Capitol Hill Arts Workshop_.

> Waiting Room

> The air was withering as it passed through the dusty window pane.
> Nothing answered the monotune of the rolling suitcase.
> A pair of black highheels tapped impatiently until a gaze rediculed them.
> Two hands spread the newspaper whose headlines melted into the wall.
> All that was happening in the world shrank next to the thin yellow sign:

> PASSENGERS MUST PURCHASE AND
> VALIDATE TICKETS PRIOR TO BOARDING THE TRAIN
