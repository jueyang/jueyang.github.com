_How long ago was that?_ 

_Three, four years ago._

_You look different now._

_That's why I take photos all the time._

_Why? To remember?_

_Yeah._

_But each time you take a photo with your phone, you are just outsourcing your memory._

_Thanks for showing me the VR. I actually cried when I saw the Northern Light out of the window._

_I wanted to show you all these possiblities and the inpirations..._

_I did see a good VR film once. It was inside a gothic church. You see the ghost of an opera singer. At some point a moon â€” really, a huge moon looms over you. I felt it in my guts..._

_When I think of inspiration I think of... like, when you have a phone call in the future, the person can just sit next to you in VR. You feel close the other person, and it feels real._

_Would you go back to that virtual room and sit next to the stranger?_

_The one who friended me? No... That was too creepy. Have you watched this episode of Black Mirror? The guys who were supposed to fight in a game ended up making out in that game..._

_The experience I had with the VR film made me realize that VR film is an individual thing. You have to make a reservation, and they help you put on your headset and headphones... The cinema is different. The cinema is a space for many people at the same time._

_That's true. I am the only one with a VR set. If my friends don't have one, I would not have anyone to call or sit next to. Then it's just me in my living room... How about the drawing your own boundaries in the setup, though? That was pretty cool, right?_
