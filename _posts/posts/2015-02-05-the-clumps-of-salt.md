My father brought a spoon with him, across the pacific ocean. A turquoise, plastic spoon.

I remember that spoon. In the first apartment in which I lived as a child — that one-and-a-half bedroom where the half doubled as the living room, whose couch hosted me for my first vampire movie and, unwilling as I was, gave me nightmares ever since, my six-year-old self — that spoon was present.

The kitchen window faced the hallway, an imposter that never received natural light. In the condiment cabinet lived three jars — one for sugar, one for MSG, and one for salt. Each of them had its own spoon; the turquoise one belonged to the salt.

When he showed me the same, only-too-familiar utensil, nostalgia came and went. “Your mom told me to wash it before bringing it on the plane,” he said, “but I couldn’t get a proper measure of salt without the weight of the clumps.”

Bear with the dingy spoon, he said, but it would help me cook delicious meals.

I had been planning for my parents' first visit to the United States. They didn't speak English, and I felt obligated to babysit them. “The real reason of our visit,” said my father, “is to sit together at the same table again, after all these years, and eat a good meal like we used to.” This simple sentiment -- this thing most people would recognize as love, effortlessly -- was overshadowed by logistics. I didn't appreciate it at the time, I thought it was a burden. And now all I can wish for is to feel the weight of the spoon.
