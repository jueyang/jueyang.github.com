He brought a spoon with him, across the pacific ocean. A turquoise, plastic spoon.

I remember that spoon. In the first apartment in which I lived as a child — that one-and-a-half bedroom where the half doubled as the living room, and whose couch hosted me for my first vampire movie and, unwilling as I was, gave me nightmares ever since, my six-year-old self — that spoon was present.

The kitchen window faced the hallway, which made it an imposter that never received natural light. In the condiment cabinet lived three jars — one for sugar, one for MSG, and one for salt. Each of them had their own spoon; the turquoise one belonged to the jar of salt.

When he showed me the same, only-too-familiar utensil, I smiled. Nostalgia came and went. “Your mom told me that I should wash it before bringing it,” he said, “but I couldn’t get a proper measure of salt without the weight of the clumps.”

Bear with the dingy spoon, he said, but it would help him cook delicious meals.

“The real reason of our visit,” said my father, “is to sit together at the same table, and eat a good meal like we used to.”

I had been planning for their first visit to the United States, and was so overwhelmed by the logistical difficulties involved at the time, that I didn’t appreciate his bland comment.

But now, at this moment of time, I wish to hold the faded turqoise.

And, accumulated over these years, the sediments of crystals.
