I took a series of photos in Mexico City from March to May 2016 for a magazine. I was a foreign(writ)er in the city and the photo editor thought my point of view would be interesting. The only requirement was that I documented the locations of the images taken. 

Due to a sudden sickness, my converstion with the editor was interrupted and the images remained unseen. When I looked at them again a few months later, much had changed. I had recuperated in other parts of the world while Mexico City endured something unexpected. *Mexico's Strongest Earthquake in a Century Left Dozens Dead*, I woke up to a headline in September.

Most of the [damages](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=19.406690296823246%2C-99.15052711742857&z=14&mid=1_-V97lbdgLFHpx-CtqhLWlJAnYY) in the city were reported in the neighborhood of *Condesa*, where I once wrote with a typewriter and baked pies for friends. I scrutinize the map, wondering if what I captured could still exist today: the lady selling tortillas in *Mercado del Valle*, the colonial facades on the streets of *Roma*, the small cart of snacks (*botanas*) around my residence in *Napoles*. I do not know. The fleeting might have vanished permenantly like the [lake](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/22/world/americas/mexico-city-earthquake-lake-bed-geology.html) on which the city was built.

For this project, I have delibereately omitted the geography and kept what is more personal. Perhaps it does not dissappear with time, the curiosity and freshness that the city gifted me. And it only grows, the dexterity between being observed and observing.

Dedico este proyecto a la Ciudad de MÃ©xico. [See the project](http://www.lemony.space/recuerdo).
