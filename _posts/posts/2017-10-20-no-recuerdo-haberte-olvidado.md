I took a series of photos in Mexico City from March to May 2017 for a magazine. I was a foreign(writ)er in the city and the photo editor thought my point of view would be interesting. The only requirement was that I documented the locations of the images taken.

My conversation with the editor was interrupted, unfortunately, as I dealt with a sudden sickness. The images were archived with names of their respective neighborhoods and remained undiscussed.

When I returned to them four months later, I had woken up to the news of Mexico's strongest earthquake in a century. A friend sent a message asking if I was okay, to which I replied, "yes, I have left the country." 

Many [damages](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=19.406690296823246%2C-99.15052711742857&z=14&mid=1_-V97lbdgLFHpx-CtqhLWlJAnYY) were reported in the neighborhood of *Condesa*, where I once wrote with a typewriter, baked pies for friends, and, over a cloudy weekend, tried to overcome a bad fever (which eventually led me to the emergency room). I scrutinized the map, wondering if what I captured could still exist today: the lady selling tortillas in *Mercado del Valle*, the colonial facades on the streets of *Roma*, the small cart of snacks (*botanas*) around my residence in *Napoles*.

The fleeting might have vanished permenantly like the [lake](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/22/world/americas/mexico-city-earthquake-lake-bed-geology.html) on which the city was built.

The city and I have endured our differing calamities. I was lucky to have recuperated while it has become a collection of fragments. Some things are gone forever. Some things will be built anew. What does not dissappear - and I believe it will only grow stronger - is the curiosity and freshness that it gifts a stranger.

For this project, I have omitted the mention of geography and kept what is more personal. It's a sort of narrative aftermath: I came from being observed to observing. The city cast its gaze on me and I, it.
