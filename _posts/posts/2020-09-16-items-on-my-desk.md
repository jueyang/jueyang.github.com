1) Two pamphlets from WIELS for the exhibitions of Thao Nguyen Phan (_Monsoon Melody_) and Wolfgang Tillmans (_Today Is the First Day_). The exhibitons were supposed to end, respectively, in April and May 2020. They were extended till July 2020 — which was when I went — as travels between Brussels and the Netherlands was a possibility again after months of quarantine. (The pamphlets are in French and Dutch. I am fluent in neither.)

2) Moyra Davey's _Index Cards_. I have written notes on the yellow bookmarks. One reads: _in search of images_. Another: _time embedded in language_. A few months ago I suggested MD as a guest artist speaker for the Master's program from which I graduated this year. MD and I have since corresponded about the logistics. She has confirmed her date to speak. I am quite happy.

3) The exhibition catalog of _Monsoon Melody_. I flipped through it before I went to see the exhibition in person. Sometimes exhibition catalogs appear in my house. I feel fortunate about that.

4) The exhibition of catalog of _Passages_, a retrospective exhibition of Chantal Akerman. I first heard of Akerman's work a year and half ago, when Ine (a tutor from my Master's) referenced _Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles_ after viewing some of my footage. Akerman's works surfaced again when I was reading a chapter on the aesthesics of diaspora this year. As this very catalog found itself into my house, Natasha, my thesis adviser, drew my attention to Akerman once again: her self-exile to New York, her being a writer and filmmaker, her texts and films with — and about — her mother. I went to see the exhibition and _No Home Movie_, her last film, in August 2020. 

5), 6) & 7) _Essays_ by Lydia Davis, _Essays on the Essay Film_ edited by Nora M. Alter and Timothy Corrigan & a book that deconstructs the image by analyzing the choices of camera lenses. I have not started to read the last one.

8) A few articles on the topic: film as composition.

9) A physcial folder of three required readings for a forum I am attending in two days, consisting: _Intercultural Communication and the Way We Think about Language_ by a professor who keeps citing one of his own forthcoming papers, one document on sign languages (and cultural hegemony) and one blog post on fair language use in international cultural cooperation. I think they might be useful when — perhaps _only_ when — placed against readings such as _Proximity and Distance in International Feminist Dialogue_ by Sara Ahmed and _On Whiteness and the Racial Imaginary_ by Claudia Rankine and Beth Loffreda, both of which I have added to the folder.

10) Three papers on _Hukou_, the Chinese household registration system.

11) Notes from two phone calls with my mom.
 
12) A few books in Dutch I picked up for free from a community reading room. One says on the cover: _Nobelprijs literatuur 1988_. I looked up the author Nabieb Mahfoez (English: Naguib Mahfouz, Arabic: نجيب محفوظ‎) and the name of the title _De moskee in de steeg: verhalen_. I have not found out about the English translation of the title.

13) An article I fished back out from the recycling bin after tossing it in the day before. It is from an old issue of _October_ (1976) and is titled _Notes on Composing in Film_. It is barely readable with its complicated syntax and academic prose. (I am thinking of adding it to the folder under 8) as an example of failed communication.)
