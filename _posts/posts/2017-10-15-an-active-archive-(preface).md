When I first built this site, it was merely an exercise. I had just learned about the basics of web development and open source software, having clicked buttons and dragged the cursor across corporately licensed interfaces.

It seemed like a distant past when I named this section <em>blog</em>, even though my posts were never as frequent as blog posts should be. In fact, the <em>blog</em> was the landing page, on which I was reluctant to declare any identity. In the <em>about</em>, I wrote down Neruda (<em>Which yellow bird fills its nest with lemons</em>?) and alluded that the site was but a space for thoughts. 

Most of the posts entailed elusive experiments on the form of text and vague discontentment associated with the labels I felt obligated to own: designer, developer, designveloper, technologist. Without being entirely aware of it, I wished to stay anonymous when I did not know who I was.

The site finally feels like an extension of my identity - and not just a presentation of it - when I changed the current landing page into <em>an introduction</em> to my becoming. I have found solace after years of questioning where I should belong. The <em>blog</em> was renamed <em>thoughts</em> and lived almost unnoticed by others and myself alike. I seldom thought of composing a new post.

Yet as a by-product of time, <em>thoughts</em> has captured my life. Although it is biased for the earlier years (2012 and 2013), I am happy to see what has emerged from it. Once a loose collection, it is now an active archive of my transitions and growth. 

To demarcate this realization, I searched my commits and dug out a version of the site when it still featured the logo, so that I could preserve [a piece](https://bl.ocks.org/jueyang/f40468c4de64dfd6ac1cc1f972cfd10b) of the past, not as an definitive end point but a process towards something else.

This gives me an idea: a systemic exhibition of preious versions of the website as a documentary of personal changes.
