I guzzle the images, transfixed. He calls them, [spaces](http://pinterest.com/shujihisada/spaces/).

Our conversation begins.

> _Me_: The light.  
> _Architect_: The light.  
> _Me_ [Walking, prancing. The place echoes.]  
> _Architect_ [Standing, smiling. The place echoes.]  
> _Me_ [Fingertips brushing against the wall. My heart beats fast.]  
> _Architect_ [Still. Watching me, and then, the openings.]  
> _Me_ [Hardly forming a sentence]: Ah.  
> _Architect_ [No words but the sound of a smile, followed by its expression.]  
> _Me_ [Arms across the walls. The wall, warm.]  
> _Architect_ [Walking up, her hand on my right shoulder. The hand, warm.]  

The lines the shadows the light. The moment surrounds me as I breathe. I am happy to be alive, to have been here, to have been born. 

Dear architect, thank you.
