<small>Note: I made this text visible in 2020 and decided to keep its original date. I have since finished a critical memoir as my Master's thesis. I can now see that so much of the memoir was seeded from this text.</small>

<hr>

Being here is a demarcation in time.

I was born into a working class family during the post-Cultural-Revolution, early economic reform China. I would not know anything about my family until many years later, after I left the country for the United States.

I studied architecture and geography in the US, then worked full-time as a web designer at a company that visualized geographic and statistical data for the World Bank and the UN. I learned how to program through that job. It allowed me to become the technologist-in-residence at the graduate school of journalism at CUNY a few years later.

I had an official version of life during the day. At night, and on the weekend: I wrote plays.

In 2016 I completed my first full-length play.

The same year I left the US indefinitely, as my third visa in my nine years of living there expired.

I moved to Mexico.

Etc.

Life seems incredulous when you try to tell it as a summary.

I am in Rotterdam. I have been here for a month. I rent a bike from _swapfiet_ and go to _Gimsel_ for bulk foods. The outdoor markets are bigger than I imagined. They remind me of the tianguis in Mexico, but instead of tortillas, I get aged cheese.

I am yet to register at the municipality, because the room I find only becomes available on October 1st. I do not yet have a BSN, and thus no bank account or phone subscription. I use a pay-as-you-go SIM, switching on the mobile data only when I need to check a message.

I've seen Mirla and Olaf, my Dutch friends, in Amsterdam three times. Soon they are going back to where they consider home now. In Chile.

I read a book by a Dutch author who wrote it in English. It reads rather stiff. 

The yoga teacher I had in Mexico is Dutch. She spends summer in Amsterdam and, when it turns grey like this, she returns to the coast of Oaxaca. She says, "in Europe, we spend so much time here in our heads."" 

It's not just Europe. It's whenever we are distracted.

I have not felt my body for quite some time.

"If you ride a lot of bikes," she says, "you are tight around the hips.""
