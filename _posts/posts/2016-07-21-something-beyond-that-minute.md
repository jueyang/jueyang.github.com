I responsed after trading links with a friend about [brutalist websites](http://brutalistwebsites.com/). Then I felt I didn't finish all my sentences.

It's not a brand new narrative. To me, how to thrive conscientiously has been a question to live (_live the questions now_, as Rilke said) -- from a belief in [architecture](/thought-on-architecture-today), to an excitement/[confusion](/a-day)) about web design, to writing.

I learned about the web by joining a company where I was entrusted to make things for which I didn't yet have the skills. _Grind coffee five times a day and learn a new language. Eat a slice of birthday pizza, then go back to the screen. Package it well and deliver the product. Scope it better next time. Over-communicate. Educate your clients. Hold the fear of not getting it right. Be assertive but nice. Maybe not nice, but definitely assertive. Play soccer._ Times fluctuated among turbulence, tedium, illumination, camaraderie. They alternated between the dark and the colorful, filled with barbeque smoke and fun like in a drunk way.

The invincible youth did not have many hangovers.

When I was at my lows for all-web-things-considered, I wrote to keep myself sane. _If I don't write I feel I am losing a piece of myself_, I expressed this sentiment. Some people empathized; others wondered if I was barely going through a phase. The _me_ that I was trying to protect wasn't very determined, either: should I keep expanding my realms of knowledge, or should I re-examine what has been my most private yet most indispensable medium of expression?

Eventually the learning took on a pause and I found myself producing similar things over and over again, an inevitable tragedy of working on client projects. I changed to a new job where people later called me "coach", a term I don't think I'll ever get used to. I help them think through their projects and products and teach them how to DIY prototypes.

I am often explaining the fundemental concepts rather than building with "the next new thing". I can afford to be a little more philosophical and a lot more thorough. Of course, at times the repeated questions bore me so much that I just have to miss those furious days of staying late and cheering PBR's after a project delivery... But this is exactly the kind of balance that allows me time and space to deepen the writing practice that I'd put aside.

I have chosen plays as my medium because it is the most resonating creative form I have experienced. To some degree, I am an author. Yet I could never fully imagine how the text would be interpreted through directions and actions; nor did I want to. The most exciting part of being a playwright is probably this: to plant the seed through language, and let it grow and blossom into surprises in the hands of others.

Through collaborations with directors, actors, and whatever else a "stage" or "production" involves, I have realized I don't just want to write. The vast space of theater and performance, broadly and everchanging-ly defined, deserves a lot more innovation, particularly on staying sustainable as a practice. I stand by the stance uttered by an editor: _I don't recommend starvation_. There should be more than one way to keep creativity sustainable -- as businesses, institutions, relationships, cultural phenomena, a combinition of them all.

There's a need for a more concrete proposal. I have a few ideas I'd like to flesh out in the next few years, even though right now my biggest concentration is the writing itself. So to clarify, what _I don't fucking know_ is where all this will land, if it does land at all, after soaring into the infinite space of possbilities.
