The setting is New York. The time is present. I am taking a picture with my phone. 

I saw her. A book of 2-by-2 denim samples in hand, she compared their colors: indigo, navy, acid washed, white. _lunk, lunk, lunk, lunk, lunk._ The train wheeled over the steel rail, sunlight broken up by the steel truss, and her gaze, suspended from the steely East River.

> Who was she?  
>  
> _The Bar_  
> Sparkling rosé, bubbling like her giggles.  
> Ceiling, full of gold, curvy tiles, full of flowers --  
> it was too dark, and everything looked like copper.  
>  
> _Her Home_  
> A potted fern. A beam of sun through the cavity between the curtains.  
> The basil scent of Mrs. Meyer that was nothing like basil at all.  
>  
> _The Fridge_  
> A wilted bunch of lettuce, a half-eaten can of chestnuts, two batteries.  
>  
> _The Counter_   
> A stem of rosemary in the olive oil, so old that    
> it witnessed in its life time  
> the evoporation of four bottles of perfume.  

I love the beginnings of imagination. The [average MTA ridership](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/) on a weekday is 5,650,610 as of 2015. Five point six million imaginations. It comforts me that I will never run out of one.

Everyday I hold up the little glowing rectangle. I find the faces. I find the hands. I find the quick glance, the empty stare, the careful scan. The train moves on, the moment disappears, the people leave. Now occupying the seats: a different skin tone, a stunning lack of wrinkles, an unrecognizable tongue, new shades of silence.

I remembered a musician.

> The door closed. Meeting his firm eyes, I asked if he needed any help, his cello wrapped in a 
black casing like a whale out of water. “No, but thank you.” He claimed with a determined independence, and carried the weight of his passion up the stairs.

The passing moments are framed with white borders, one picture after another. We are all but human, they say. And what else? 

_The universe is born out of a singularity._
