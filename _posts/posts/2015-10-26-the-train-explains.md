The setting is New York, the time is present. 

I take pictures of people everyday on [the train](https://instagram.com/the.train). It started with an accidental shot of the uncanny resemblance of [Audrey Hepburn](https://instagram.com/p/9GjVfiCl__/). We sat across from each other. She had a book of 2-by-2 denim samples; she compared their colors and textures; her gaze went from the book to the window, as the train went onto the Manhattan Bridge. 

> A fashion designer, quite possibly. Orders a sparkling rosÃ© at the bar with a high ceiling. Giggles when complimented. Wears her pair of glasses -- a light metal frame -- in front of her sewing machine at home. A potted fern. The fridge opens and the light shines on the chestnut puree. There is a stem of rosemary in the olive oil.  

I hold up the little rectangle that is my phone, pretending to read. Capture: a quick glance, an empty stare, a careful scan. Find: a face, two pinky fingers, three thoughts, lost at the tip of the tongue. The train moves on, the moment disappears, the same seat now occupied by a different skin tone, stunning lack of wrinkles, unrecognizable languages, new shades of silence. 

[The average MTA ridership](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/) on a weekday is 5,597,551, as of 2014. That is five point five million imaginations, amongst which you are one.

> The train leaves. Meeting a set of firm eyes, his cello wrapped in a black casing like a whale out of water, you ask the musician if he needs any help. "No. But thank you." A determined independence, and he goes up the stairs, carrying the weight of his passion.

The passing moments are framed with white borders -- one new image every day. They say, the universe is born out of a singularity.
