Thinking about architecture. Structure is one thing, aesthetics another, form yet another. There might be some overlap, but one encompassing term can mean too many things to different minds.

_Also to give a tribute for the sake of memory and demarcation at this digital age where forgetfulness is not only accepted but encouraged (otherwise how can one make sense of the world), I want to note that 'this is the first post' when I learned to build the site._
