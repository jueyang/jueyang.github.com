> It went into me, as part of my life. Then it comes out from somewhereâ€”from my emotions or whatever, my feelings.

Zumthor has expressed the relationship between personal memories, perception, feelings, emotions and how they influence his architecture in [his 2009 Pritzker Prize speech](http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2009/ceremony_speech1). I was very much moved by what he said, which, not coincidentally, reminded me of Neruda's _Poetry_.

> Poetry (first stanza)

> And it was at that age ... Poetry arrived  
> in search of me. I don't know, I don't know where  
> it came from, from winter or a river.  
> I don't know how or when,  
> no they were not voices, they were not   
> words, nor silence,  
> but from a street I was summoned,  
> from the branches of night,  
> abruptly from the others,  
> among violent fires  
> or returning alone,  
> there I was without a face  
> and it touched me.
