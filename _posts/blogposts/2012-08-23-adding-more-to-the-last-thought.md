> It went into me, as part of my life. Then it comes out from somewhereâ€”from my emotions or whatever, my feelings.

[Zumthor](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/magazine/mag-13zumthor-t.html?pagewanted=all) has expressed the relationship between personal memories, perception, feelings, emotions and his architecture in [his 2009 Pritzker Prize speech](http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2009/ceremony_speech1). I was very much moved by what he said, which, not coincidentally, reminded me of Neruda's _Poetry_. To me, this is a budding articulation of the relationship between the architect and his/her work.
