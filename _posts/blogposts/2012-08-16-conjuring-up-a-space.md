title: Conjuring up a space

I moved into a space filled with light, which has been inspiring. The objects in the room seem fitting with simple geometry. Walls are bare except for a framed drawing a friend finished for me recently. I think when a space takes on character, it is manifested in the things that dwell in it. 

Things speak and create what you might call an aura. It is not completely bogus, but rather the result of a hundred little things being perceived. A curator designs an exhibition so that the audience leave, feeling exhilarated by what he or she understands from what was seen, heard and touched.

I am sure there are vague discussions on such communication between objects and perception in a space. I am yet to articulate those, but for now, I appreciate sunlight that wakes me up at a decent hour.
