title: Conjuring up a space

I moved into a space filled with light, which has been inspiring. The objects in the room seem fitting with simple geometry. Walls are bare except for a framed drawing a friend finished for me recently. I think when a space takes on character, it is manifested in the things that dwell in it. Things speak. When people feel a certain aura in a space, it's not completely bogus, or at all. It's the result of a hundred little things being perceived. A curator designs an exhibition so that the audience leave, feeling exhilarated by what he or she understands from what was seen, heard and touched.

I am sure there is some school of philosophy that discusses such communication between objects and perception in a space. That's getting vague, even for me it's a little much. I appreciate sunlight that wakes me up at decent hour.
