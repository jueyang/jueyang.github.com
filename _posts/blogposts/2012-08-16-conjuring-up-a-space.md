I moved into a space filled with light, which has been inspiring. The objects in the room seem fitting with simple geometry. Walls are bare except for a framed drawing [a friend](http://trashmoon.com/) finished for me recently. I think when a space takes on character, it is manifested in the things that dwell in it.

Things create an aura - an accurate reflection of what is perceived. I don't mean to use the word with its new-agey connotations, nor do I equal accurate perception to accurate communication - you might easily feel something, yet remain speechless as you try to explain. This aura can be calm - it might have come from the ivy by the window, the soft yellow light from your lamp, the wooden floor, the paper latterns, the block of sun that only appears after mid-morning.

Whenever I organize things in the space, I feel I am adding a piece to an experience. A curator designs an exhibition in hope for the audience to leave, feeling exhilarated by what was seen, heard and touched. Even if the intention is to educate, the curator does it ever so gently. The knowledge does not come and stay as a block of text or an image.

What I want to draw from this curator analogy is the process of collecting, filtering and synthesizing through a personal lens. That, rather than the result and form of such act. A space filled with carefully chosen objects - not expensive or fancy, but placed with thoughts - is a curation itself. 

For now, I appreciate sunlight that wakes me up at a decent hour.
