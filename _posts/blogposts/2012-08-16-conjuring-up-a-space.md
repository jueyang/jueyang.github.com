title: Conjuring up a space

I moved into a space filled with light, which has been inspiring. The objects in the room seem fitting with simple geometry. Walls are bare except for a framed drawing a friend finished for me recently. I think when a space takes on character, it is manifested in the things that dwell in it. 

Things speak - they create what you might call an aura, an accurate reflection of what is perceived. A curator designs an exhibition so that the audience leave, feeling exhilarated by what was seen, heard and touched.

I am yet to articulate the communication between objects and perception in a space, but for now, I appreciate sunlight that wakes me up at a decent hour.
