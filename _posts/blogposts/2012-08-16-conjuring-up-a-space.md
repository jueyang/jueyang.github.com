title: Conjuring up a space

I moved into a space filled with light, which has been inspiring. The objects in the room seem fitting with simple geometry. Walls are bare except for a framed drawing [a friend](http://trashmoon.com/) finished for me recently. I think when a space takes on character, it is manifested in the things that dwell in it.

Things speak: they create what you might call an aura, an accurate reflection of what is perceived. I do not equate accuracy to articulation here - you might easily feel something, yet remain speechless as you try to explain. A curator designs an exhibition in hope for the audience to leave, feeling exhilarated by what was seen, heard and touched. Even if the intention is to educate, the curator does it ever so gently. The knowledge does not come and stay as a block of text or an image.

What I want to draw from this curator analogy is the process of collecting, filtering and synthesizing through a personal lens. That, rather than the result and form of such act. A space filled with carefully chosen objects - not expensive or fancy, but placed with thoughts - is a curation itself. 

For now, I appreciate sunlight that wakes me up at a decent hour.
