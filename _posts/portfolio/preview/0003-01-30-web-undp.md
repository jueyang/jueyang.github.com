I started working on the open data portal for the [United Nation Developement Program](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html) by adding features, such as viewing all projects specific to a country. I have subsequently redesigned the UI. I am now in the process of refactoring its [codebase](https://github.com/undp/undp.github.com) on GitHub so that it becomes truly open-source-friendly.
