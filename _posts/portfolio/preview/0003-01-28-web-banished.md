I built the site for [banished productions](http://banishedproductions.org), an avant pop theater compapny based in DC. Besides the UI, I created a [Prose.io](https://prose.io) + [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) workflow for the banished crew so that they can maintain and add to [the gh-pages site](https://github.com/banishedproductions/banishedproductions.github.io) themselves.
