I created [LearnOSM.org](http://learnosm.org) to help the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/about) build a central hub where information is more easily accessed. Before the site came about on [GitHub](https://github.com/hotosm/learnosm), all HOT guides and workshop materials were nested in Google Docs.
