A call comes from _Unknown Number_.

It's the fourth call I have with the bureau regarding my rights to the health insurance and the third correspondence I have with the same lady (after previous calls and correspondence with three different people).

_You have sent relevant information,_ she said, _now I would like to ask you a few more questions._

_Did you have the intention to stay in the Netherlands or are you unable to leave because of corona?_

_Can you renew your permit?_

_When is your lease due?_

_Oh — your partner, do you mean, your housemate or your —_

_Do you live together?_

Her tone is indifferent. 

I try to locate where the violence comes from.

Either I cannot take out one insurance or I cannot take out the other insurance. Both accept my monthly payment willingly. Both could reject my claims should I become ill. 

My file confuses the system, but my money doesn't.

(Gladly, the tax office — after my written objection — has decided to refund me what they deem I deserve.)

A few hours later I hear back from my lawyer. 

For my next permit, the first thing the immigration office asks for:

_proof of your health insurance_

### *

three days ago there was a riot near my house

burning motocycle

shattered shop windows

smoke-filled air

among loud,

angry,

excited chatters

I fell asleep 

I fell asleep

after I said "I love you, good night"

after I heard "good night, I love you"

### *

When I cannot breathe, I think of all the times that I can.

I think of great love, great sea, great light.

And I can breathe again.

And I am here again.
