# _The case in which I have no memory (of my own words)_

I dug out an old programming project from 2014 and fixed a few bugs. It's called <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/artist-rooms" target="_blank">_Artist Rooms_</a> — after the collection of the same name at the Tate Gallery. Reading the code I wrote 6 years ago is not unlike reading my old diary from middle school: I know it was me who typed those lines and penned those words, but I can hardly remember writing any of it. (I also don't remember using a glitter pen in a yellow-covered notebook at the age of 11. I laughed very hard upon re-discovering the book.)

(Why are errors called bugs in programming? I must have lookd this up at some point.)

When I talked to her, my mother was amazed that I still remembered how to code. "It's kind of like a language," I said, "I might get rusty, but I don't think I will forget it totally. Plus, I worked too much back then —"

"Yes, you did."

"It's forever burned into me. Forever altered my brain."

I told my mother I was feeling down the other day. "I thought of what you told me about my earliest days. Then I thought this sadness makes a lot of sense." 

I have no memory of my earliest days. I only summon up images based on my mother's recount.

She said, apologetically, "would it've been better had I not told you about those times?"

"No. I'd rather not to feel sad blindly," I said, "I am glad you told me."

(I read on the wikipedia page on Grace Hopper, a woman computer scientist in the 1950's US — "[w]hile she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay...For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.")

# _The case in which I do not see myself in another's words_

In a recent email, one of the organizers from the Kranj Collage Festival in Slovenia alerted me that the festival had started and that I could read about my work on page 72 of the catalogue. I clicked on the digital publication and found the following:

1) I am listed under _Kitajska_.

2) Via Google Translate (GT): _Her way of the collage method is marked by a very subtle use of combining shots of reflective and prose surfaces. In this way, on the spectrum between more expressive, formalistic research and, on the other hand, realism, we place it on the latter, as it approaches cinematic visual effects through illusionist fusion._

2.1) I am not so sure if I understand my work with the description. It feels too abstracted. I do like the term "prose surface" — whatever it means.

3) GT: _Under the exhibit she wrote:_ You are I am the reflection is you. _The collage of words can be read in several ways: you are me, I am you as a reflection and as a reflection I am you. It opens up the question of identity and otherness, which connects it if we highlight just a few of the most famous, with Lacan's famous reflection on the role of the mirror stage, Sartre's double structure of being-on-himself and being-on, and the empathetic vision of Second French writer Victor Hugo vase identity of the identity of all people._

3.1) I feel a constricting weight — the image of a Baroque frame comes to mind — with these references. I have chuckled at the term "OWG" — _Old White Guy_ — which to me connotates partriarchy, authority and intellectualism. I acknowledge their contirbutions to some extent, but with that acknowledgement I must raise questions to the context that shaped their so-called canonical status. In my thesis, I wrote about hosting a dinner party with André Bazin, Andrei Tarkovsky, John Berger and Ellen Kuras.  Needless to say, the OWGs at my dinner were a bit stiff (although — I will give him the credit — Berger was one of the good ones). I was very glad to have some solidarity with Kuras.
