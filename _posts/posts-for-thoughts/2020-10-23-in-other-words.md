# _The case in which I have no memory (of my own words)_

I dug out an old programming project from 2014 and fixed a few bugs. It's called <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/artist-rooms" target="_blank">_Artist Rooms_</a> — after the collection of the same name at the Tate Gallery. Reading the code I wrote 6 years ago is not unlike reading my old diary from middle school: I know it was me who typed those lines and penned those words, but I can hardly remember writing any of it.

(What I also don't remember: using a glitter pen in a yellow-covered notebook at the age of 11 & why errors are called "bugs" in programming.)

When I talked to her, my mother was amazed that I still remembered how to code. "It's like language," I said, "I might get rusty, but I don't think I will forget it totally. Plus, I worked too much back then —"

"Yes, you did."

"It's forever burned into me. Probably forever altered my brain."

I told my mother I was feeling down the other day. "I thought of what you told me about my earliest days. Then I thought, oh, this sadness makes a lot of sense." 

I have no memory of my earliest days. I only summon up images based on my mother's recount.

She said, apologetically, "would it be better if I never told you about those times?"

"No. I'd much rather feel sad knowing why I feel sad than to feel sad blindly." 

She fell a bit silent.

"I am glad you told me."

I read the wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a>, a woman computer scientist in the 1950's United States. _While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay [an electrically operated switch]; the moth impeded the operation of the relay...For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C._

# _The case in which I do not see myself in another's words_

In a recent email, one of the organizers from the Kranj Collage Festival in Slovenia alerted me that the festival had started and that I could read about my work on page 72 of the catalogue. I clicked on the digital publication and found the following:

1) Via Google Translate (GT): _Her way of the collage method is marked by a very subtle use of combining shots of reflective and prose surfaces. In this way, on the spectrum between more expressive, formalistic research and, on the other hand, realism, we place it on the latter, as it approaches cinematic visual effects through illusionist fusion._

I am not sure if I understand my work with this abstract description. I do like the term _prose surface_, though. It has the potential of meaning.

2) (GT) _Under the exhibit she wrote:_ You are I am the reflection is you. _The collage of words can be read in several ways: you are me, I am you as a reflection and as a reflection I am you. It opens up the question of identity and otherness, which connects it if we highlight just a few of the most famous, with Lacan's famous reflection on the role of the mirror stage, Sartre's double structure of being-on-himself and being-on, and the empathetic vision of Second French writer Victor Hugo vase identity of the identity of all people._

I feel a constricting weight as I read these references. They are a Baroque frame around what I have made. I chuckle at the term "OWG" — Old White Guy — which connotates partriarchy, authority and intellectualism. I refuse to acknowledge the canonical status of OWGs — their so-called being "famous" — without raising questions about the context in which they rose to such privileged positions.

It is the art writer's responsibility to be critical about over-cited OWGs, stay vigilant about the perpetuating discourses and systems and consider, encourage and promote voices that are anything but. In my thesis, I wrote about hosting a dinner party with André Bazin, Andrei Tarkovsky, John Berger and Ellen Kuras. Needless to say, the OWGs at this dinner were a bit stiff.  In the end, I was very glad to be able to share solidarity with Kuras, at woman cinematographer. (I'd give Berger the credit of being one of the good ones.)

3) My name is listed under _Kitajska_.

To my dismay, my name and origin have been used, once again, to perform a nationality without my consent. At least from now on I have a new answer to those unthinking where-are-you-from questions — (in well-enunciated, if not flamboyant, English) _I am from kiii-taaaj-skaaa_. I'd like to introduce some hesitation to the assumptions that come with that question. (If the questioner happens to speak Slovenian, my answer might change to: _I am from Tuam Tshoj_.)
