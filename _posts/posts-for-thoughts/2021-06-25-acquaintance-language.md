We talk about how our weekends went in the language class. 

I do not like small talk.

It is only in a foreign language where I can make some small talk and feel that I have not betrayed myself.

The foreign language is an acquaintance language, with which I recall a fact with a smile and call it good.

_Wat heb je gedaan dit weekend?_

Words I have: 

_Ik heb planken geplaatst aan de muur_ I installed shelves on the wall

_en ik heb naar een podcast geluisterd_ and I listened to a podcast.

Words I do not:

The poet and music critic in the podcast said his therapist once pointed out his tendency to mourn. It reminded me of the book review of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's _Notes on Grief_, a book in which she mourned about her father's passing in June, 2020. When I read it I thought, that was not long ago, the emotions you felt would be different in ten years. 

Then I thought, mourning _is_ an urgent matter.

Words I have:

_Ik heb veel gedroomd_ I have dreamed a lot

Words I do not:

In my dreams, places and people from the past and the unknown converge. Sometimes I shout in my dreams. I wish I knew how to dream lucidly, how to change my dream fate. The more viscerally disturbing the dreams are, the more I remember of them.

It is as if out of the obligation of memory that I attribute more significane to them. 

Words I have:

_Ik heb wat poëzie gelezen_ I read some poetry

Words I do not:

In my waking hours, I read 20th century literature from a recently acquired Penguin set of Modern Classics. Translated literature from the era comes with the drawl of a foreign tongue. The sentence structures, translated literally, seem to poeticize everything.

I used to think that poetry comes from the blurry spaces of illegibility, from the unspoken and the unspeakable — not anymore.

Words I have: 

_Ik heb met mijn moeder gepraat_ I talked to my mother

Words I do not:

On picking up my phone, she sounded full of laughter, the first time in months. She, too, had been mourning. Her knee was not doing so well, she said, and she did not want to mention it because she worried that I would worry. 

I nodded silently on this side of the phone. I thought of losing sight of her at the department store one day. That day, I remembered her saying as both of us cried:

Don't move, okay? Stay at the same place, okay?
