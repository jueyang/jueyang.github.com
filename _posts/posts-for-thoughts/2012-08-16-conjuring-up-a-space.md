I moved into a space filled with light, which has been inspiring. The objects in the room seem fitting with simple geometries. Walls are bare except for a framed drawing a friend finished for me recently. I think when a space takes on character, it is manifested in the things that dwell in it.

Things create an aura - an accurate reflection of what is perceived. I don't mean to use the word with its new-agey connotations, nor do I equal accurate perception to accurate communication - you might easily feel something, yet remain speechless as you try to explain. This aura can be calm - it might have come from the ivies by the window, the soft light from the lamp, the wooden floor, the paper latterns, the block of sun that only appears after mid-morning.

Whenever I organize things in the space, I feel I am adding a piece to an experience. A curator designs an exhibition in hope for the audience to leave exhilarated by what they see, hear and touch. Even if the intention is to educate, the curator does it ever so gently. The knowledge does not come and stay as a block of text or an image.

What I want to draw from this curator analogy is the process of collecting, filtering and synthesizing through a personal lens. A space filled with carefully chosen objects - placed with thoughts - is a curation itself.

For now, I appreciate sunlight that wakes me up at a decent hour.
