title: "Thank You (This Is Not a Thank You)"
---

I received a third letter from the bureau.

The first one was written in Dutch, except for the line: _We did not invite you to a hearing at our office because we fully agree with your point of view._

I put the letter aside and basked in my right to health insurance.

I was, momentarily, free of bureaucratic concerns. 

I reclaimed a right from the blank stares of

(_oppression_, I wanted to say, but perhaps it was only)

(innocent)

(how come that I already minimized the whole ordeal into)

 _negligence_

The second letter was written in English, a brief version of the first one. The third, sent two weeks later, was a full translation of letter #1.

Ms. S— was feeling something. (I did know her initials from our correspondence.)

I typed a few sentences on my laptop, exported it as a pdf and uploaded it through the bureau's website, the place where I had previously uploaded government forms, invoices, tax returns.

> Dear Ms. S—, 
> 
> I feel sufficiently informed.
> 
> Thank you.
>
> Best,

It's the Dutch election season. I finally read an article about the parties and Members of Parliament. 

I wonder whom I would vote for, should I be able to vote.

I have not had the right to vote in the past decade.

Yet I speak of "systemic change." 

There is something terrible and terribly funny about this contrivance.

I have been a believer of law because I have believed in fairness. I have consulted five lawyers in my life, four of which have been immigration lawyers. I am working with one now to figure out my life in this country. 

Ever since I learned the word "litigious" I have used it to describe myself.

I file my tax (enthusiastically).

I call out a problematic clause at the lease signing with the landlord and write an email saying "my lawyer has informed me that your security deposit request is illegal."

I read the legal requirements of immigration.

I trudge through paperworks I have to produce to prove that I am capable and "relevant".

I itemize my life.

Here is my life's asset and inventory in monetary value, my cultural significance, my place in the labor market.

I am a tragic diplomat, having learned to speak the neo-liberal language, which is used to make the law.

As I experience immigration — once all over again, five years after I left the US — I realize what I have ignored for all these years:

Laws are made by law-makers.

Law-makers represent interests more than justice.

Fairness — what I thought the foundation of law — is relative and convoluted.

Reading Audre Lorde's _Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism_, for the second time:

_Hatred is the fury of those who do not share our goals, and its object is death and destruction. Anger is a grief of distortions between peers, and its object is change... Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to one's own actions or lack of action... [A]ll too often, guilt is just another name for impotence... it becomes a device to protect ignorance and the continuation of things the way they are, the ultimate protection for changelessness._

"I felt I am caught in limbo with this voluntary act to check my health insurance right," I said to Ms. S— at the end of our last phone call, "I did not have to do this."

There was a pause after.

Then she said, "I understand."

Then she sent me three letters.

I hear a voice.

_But you could have had it worse. We are ensuring rights of foreigners like you!_

I hear myself speaking.

_Didn't you also make laws so that for foreigners to have the same job as a national would, the salaries are reduced?_

_Yes, to incentivize companies to hire foreigners. We are providing opportunities for you!_

_But if I were an EU-national, this law would not apply._

_Well we are part of EU and we want to encourage freedom of movement and access to labor market between union members._

_Do you mean that people born in the EU have more rights than others?_

_There are priorities in things._

_You mean, priorities in people and priorities defined by nationality (and class, race, age, gender, sexuality, religion, ableness)?_

_If you have so many problems with the system, you don't have to stay._

_No thank you._

I turn to my books: _Notes on Nationalism_, _The Thing Around Your Neck_, _Pleasure Activism_
