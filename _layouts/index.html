    <p>I like words and space. I guess you can call me one of the following based on your preferred framework: trans-media writer, writer for performance, playwright.</p>
    <p>Currently intrigued by: pause, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-death-of-the-artist-and-the-birth-of-the-creative-entrepreneur/383497/"  target="_blank">the death of the artist</a>, structure of the body, non-capitalist systems, and the vastness of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150430-space-time-interactive/" target="_blank">quantum fabric</a>.</p>

      <h2>Playwright</h2>
      <p>I have submitted scripts and applied to events and residencies as a playwright. It has been an identity in which I find freedom. (I do think, however, that the majority of the business mechanisms -- thus the expectations and products they generate -- are outdated. Working on it by learning, questioning, and innovating.)</p>

      <h2>Identities in Transition</h2>
      <p>I have three portfolios summarizing my education and experiences as a working being. This includes being a cartographer, an aspiring architect, and a technologist (keywords: <span style="font-family:'Inconsolata', monospace;">data, design, develop</span>). Each one was created when I looked for the next job. As a writer, I have been re-evaluating such notion of a "working being". What kind of way of life is that? Before I had words to confidently answer that, I wrote a play for myself to figure it out.

      <h2>Inklings of a Practice</h2>
      <p>I created some independent projects over the years because I felt the urge to have a practice, even though I could not give it a name then. I also wrote things when I did not know better, which I believe is ever ongoing.</p>
