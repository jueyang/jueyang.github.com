    <p><em>I called this section "blog" for a period of time. It was a time when I didn't really know what blogs were for. (I did not know many things then. I still don't â€” but that's a slightly different story.) As a result, you might experience pompousness, obliqueness, typos and a lack of editing in proses from the earlier years. I ask for your understanding. Thank you.</em></p>
