    <p><em>I used to call this page: blog. I wrote when I felt I had something to say, but I was not always good at saying them. As a result, there might be pompousness, obliqueness, typos and a lack of editing in the earlier proses. (For those I ask for your understanding.) I started writing here again in 2020. Time has passed, and both the world and I have changed. One of these changes is the title of the page, which is now: thoughts.</em></p>
