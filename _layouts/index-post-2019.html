	<p>Dear Visitor,</p>

    <p>The protagonist of the video is <em>Jue</em> — with a pronounciation between <em>Joe</em> and <em>Yue</em>, aptly suggested by your phone's autocorrect. She also writes you this web note and realizes the confusion of the third-person pronoun. So.</p>

	<p>I am a writer and filmmaker. I say this because I write and make films. I have done other things in the past, and have recorded some of them in my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> (from Latin, "<em>course of life</em>"). I have traveled and moved around quite a bit: at times by choice, at times not. Right now I reside in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p>

	<p>The site will be brief for now, as I am focusing on two projects: a memoir and a documentary film. To get a sense of my work, you might find this (albeit slightly outdated) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent/JY-DOSSIER-2019.pdf" target="_blank">portfolio</a> useful. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, please write to <em>lemony.space[at]gmail.com</em> — thank you.</p>

	<p>Yours Truly</p>
