	<p>This site belongs to the writer and filmmaker, Jue Yang.</p>
	<p>In May 2020: </p>
	<p>The world is still moving at a strange pace.</p>
	<p>She updated her <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent">cirriculum vitae</a>.*</p>
	<p>She finished a memoir. </p>
	<p>She does not want to stop writing.</p>
	<p>She unearths a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/thoughts">blog-like thing</a> from what seems to be decades ago — which is, really, oceans away — and starts adding new pieces to it.</p>
	<h1>(She awaits the stars.)</h1>
	<h3>* They say it is the <em>course of life</em>,<br>
	but what is a course but drips of time pooling<br>
	into an existence forgotten, at times, by the one who inhabits it —<br>
	the archive, for those who attempt a journey within it,<br>
	will have a narrative.</h3>
	<p><em>Come back in a month or two. This place is changing like the sand.</em></p>
	<p><em>When the northern islands start to welcome visitors again, I want to take a ferry, dig my toes in the silt, and nap in the nape of dunes.</em></p>
	<p>She writes this in the Netherlands, signing:</p>
	<p><em>May you be safe.</em></p>
	<p><em>Truly & Yours</em></p>
	<h1>(And they do rise.)</h1>
