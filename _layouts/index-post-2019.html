	<p>This site belongs to the writer and filmmaker, Jue Yang.</p>
	<p>In May 2020: </p>
	<p>The world is still moving at a strange pace.</p>
	<p>She updated her <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent">cirriculum vitae</a>.*</p>
	<p>She finished a memoir. </p>
	<p>She does not want to stop writing.</p>
	<p>She unearths a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/thoughts">blog</a> from what seems to be decades ago — which is, really, oceans away — and starts adding new pieces to it.</p>
	<p>Her email is still lemony.space@gmail.com</p>
	<h1>(She awaits for the stars.)</h1>
	<h3>* They say it is the <em>course of life</em>.<br>
	Not much has changed but drips of time pooling<br>
	into an existence forgotten by the one who inhabits it.<br>
	They say the <em>archive</em> has a narrative.</h3>
	<p><em>Come back in a month or two. This place is changing.</em></p>
	<p><em>May you be safe.</em></p>
	<p>She writes this in the Netherlands, signing:</p>
	<p>Yours Truly,</p>
	<p>Yours,</p>
	<h1>(And they do rise.)</h1>
