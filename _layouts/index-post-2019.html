  	<h1>Departure</h1>
 
	<p><em>I have forgotten the word for jasmine,</em> the woman in yellow said.</p>
	<p><em>Oh,</em> the woman in green said. She wanted to quote the lyrics from the only song she knew in Chinese. Now she held them with half a breath.</p>
	<p><em>It's strange to forget such a common word</em>, the woman in yellow said.</p>
	<p><em>Well, it's — </em></p>
	<p><em>No don't remind me. It has gone so far. For so long. When I think about it — and I am thinking about it now — it does not exist, for me, anymore... I am not offended or sad even. I don't feel a thing, yet it's not indifference. How strange, and incredible.</em></p>
	<p><em>How — but how can you forget?</em></p>
	<p><em>I am not forgetting. It's like the old building of my memory is taken over by plants, their leaves covering the bricks, their roots cracking the red clay. Into dust you go. The dwellers are gone, if there were dwellers at all. No expunction. No violence. Just time, and the sound of birds.</em></p>
	<p>The woman in yellow closed her eyes and inhaled. Her chest rose and rose and rose. When it finally fell again, she looked into the sky. There was no answer. <em>I don't remember what it smelled like.</em></p>
	<p>Her companion looked at her with terror. <em>It's a pity,</em> the woman in green said, masking her disbelief with sympathy.</p>
	<p><em>To not miss what I no longer know?</em> The woman in yellow smiled, her eyes hazel under the sun.</p>
	<p><em>Hao yi duo mei li de muo li hua, hao yi duo mei li de muo li hua...</em> The woman in green hummed.</p>
	<p><em>What is the song?</em></p>
	<p><em>...Muo li hua.</em></p>
