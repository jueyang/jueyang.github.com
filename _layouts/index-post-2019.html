	<p>Dear Visitor,</p>

    <p>The author and protagonist of the video is <em>Jue</em> — with a pronounciation between <em>Joe</em> and <em>Yue</em>, aptly suggested by your phone's autocorrect. She also writes you this web letter, which makes the third-person pronoun confusing. So.</p>

	<p>My current practices are writing and filmmaking. I have done other things in the past, which I have included in my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> (from Latin, "<em>course of life</em>"). I have traveled and moved around quite a bit: sometimes by choice, sometimes not. Right now I reside in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p>

	<p>The site will be brief as I am focusing on writing a memoir and making a documentary. If you would like to get a sense of my work, here is a (slightly outdated) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent/JY-DOSSIER-2019.pdf" target="_blank">portfolio</a> from 2019. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, please write to <em>lemony.space[at]gmail.com</em> — I will be honored to hear from you.</p>

	<p>More soon.</p>

	<p>Yours Truly</p>
