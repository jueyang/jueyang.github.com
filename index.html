		<p>I am a technologist...Yes, that's a term. It's vague, and whenever I use the word people follow up by asking, "so what does that mean?" Usually I just simplify it and say I teach journalists how to code.</p>

		<p>I have become rational, efficient, pragmatic and... desensitized. The unforeseen opportunities have shaped my trajectory. I made websites, constructed information architecture, geo-located ideas and patterns. Nothing was tangible but the keyboard. Nothing was visible but the glowing screen. And somewhere in the process, I started to refrain from calling myself an artist.</p>

		<p>I had this epiphany once. I was at an architecture critique. One of my studio mates was presenting, but I didn't remember his project at all. My brain was filled with words and images and sketches... I was so deep in thought, and... all of a sudden -- beyond the control of my consciousness -- they started to zoom out, like a camera that was very close started to pull away, away, and away...until all those letters and drawings became a square. One. Single. Square. Dense with information. Yet unintelligible. The camera moved on to a different block of words and images. Close up at first, and the same thing happened -- away...away...and away! </p>
		<p class="direction">(points to a place on the page)</p>
		<p>I ended up with all these neatly organized squares. It was the <em>definition of synthesis</em>. I remember thinking, is this what abstraction is? Is this how my brain organizes chaos? Is this, actually, how the human mind works?</p>
		<p class="direction">(more calmly)</p>
		<p>I thought by living -- by learning things that I would not have dreamed of being capable of -- I would reach something. Another level of synthesis.</p>

		<p>The first time I organized a bunch of code into objects I had a flashback of <em>just that</em>: the camera zooming out. Later I learned more vocabularies in programming: functions, patterns, modules... I have finally found the precise words to describe that moment of epiphany. My metaphors expanded: data structure, building structure; binding data to a node, associating meaning with a name. It feels as though I was learning a new language and doing stand-up in it. People laugh because the wit is real, even though it's not my mother tongue, but --</p>
