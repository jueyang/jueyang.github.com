		<p>I am a technologist...Yes, that's a term. It's vague, and whenever I use the word people follow up by asking, "so what does that mean?" Usually I just simplify it and say I teach journalists how to code.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>I thought simplification bugged you. Did't you like the liberal arts way of defining things?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Still do. The fluffy way. But nuanced discussions are not always immediately available. Many conversations are 10 seconds long and dead.</p>

		<p>You think you are being labeled, so you don't bother to explain.</p>

		<p>You are right. My defense mechanism in a world filled with pre-judgements, impatience, and small talks is contributing to the very problem.</p>

	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>It's not an easy thing to do, but you must do it. Be genuine and kind. Dismiss nothing until you have given everything.</p>

		<p>You know what's funny though? When I wanted to be an architect a few years ago, I was told -- by my mentors, by the books, by the idols I had at the time -- to LIVE, and do so with tremedous humility.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>An architect is the very profession of empathy.</p>

		<p>What's that metaphor for?</p>

	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>The fact that I've become rational, efficient, pragmatic and, to some extent, desensitized. And I refuse to call myself an artist.</p>

	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Well first of all, what you described is called being a driven young American in New York City. Second, what's wrong with calling yourself an artist?</p>

	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>You make things for yourself. And that's selfish.</p>

		<p>An artist can be as selfless or narcissistic as she wants to be. You are the one who detest simplification, aren't ya. And you know that you have idealized the profession of an architect?</p>

		<p>Yes. Yes, I have. But that was a time where I...</p>
		<p class="direction">(pulls out a sketchbook from the bookshelf and flips to a page)</p>
		<p>I had this epiphany once. I was at an architecture critique with all the guests. One of my studio mates was presenting, but I was so deep in thought with my own project. My brain was filled with words and images and sketches... but all of a sudden -- beyond the control of my consciousness -- they started to zoom out, like a camera that was very close started to pull away, away...and away...until all those letters and drawings became a square. One. Single. Square. Dense with information, yet unintelligible. The camera moved on to a different block of words and images, close up, and the same thing happened -- away...away...and away! </p>
		<p class="direction">(points to a place on the page)</p>
		I ended up with all these neatly organized squares. It was the <em>definition of patterns</em>. Patterns! I remember thinking, is this what abstraction is? Is this how my brain organizes chaos? Is it, actually, how the human mind works??? 
		<p class="direction">(more calmly)</p>
		The first time I organized a bunch of code into objects I had a flashback of <em>just that</em>. Later I learned more vocabularies in programming: patterns, in the programming sense, modules... I have finally found the precise words to describe that moment of epiphany.

		<p>Whoever has the ears for the story, I will tell them how deeply satifying it is to see the connections between different disciplines -- and to be able to get very good at something you thought you never would. How I love the metaphors. Data structure, building structure. Binding data to a node, associating meaning with a name. How it's all very philosophical. It's almost as if you were learning a new language AND doing stand-up comedy in it, and people laugh because your wit is real despite your mother tongue.</p>

		<p>And of course I'll tell them how I've endured the boring, the stressful, the demanding -- times of production. On those days it feels like working on a construction drawing of a condo that you didn't design.

		<p>Ironic, isn't it. The production process across all fields.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>How I've been blocked many many times by concepts and new knowledge over my head. I've made a fool of myself by blowing the scope -- that's today's speak of "you fucked up the budget". I took on more than what I could chew. But I learn...How I learn in the end.</p>
