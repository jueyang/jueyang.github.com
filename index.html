		<p>I am a technologist...Yes, that's a term. You know what's funny though? I wanted to be an architect just a few years ago. I was told -- by my mentors, by the books, by the idols I had at the time -- to LIVE, and do so with tremedous humility.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>An architect is the very profession of empathy.</p>
		<p class="direction">(finds it profound, yet funny)</p>
		<p>Now I have empathized with computers.</p>

		<p>I think so...</p>
		<p class="direction">(pulls out a sketchbook from the bookshelf and flips to a page)</p>
		<p>I had this epiphany once. I was at an architecture critique with all the guests. One of my studio mates was presenting, but I was so deep in thought with my own project. My brain was filled with words and images and sketches... but all of a sudden -- beyond the control of my consciousness -- they started to zoom out, like a camera that was very close started to pull away, away...and away...until all those letters and drawings became a square. One. Single. Square. Dense with information, yet unintelligible. The camera moved on to a different block of words and images, close up, and the same thing happened -- away...away...and away! </p>
		<p class="direction">(points to a place on the page)</p>
		I ended up with all these neatly organized squares. It was the <em>definition of patterns</em>. Patterns! I remember thinking, is this what abstraction is? Is this how my brain organizes chaos? Is it, actually, how the human mind works??? 
		<p class="direction">(more calmly)</p>
		The first time I organized a bunch of code into objects I had a flashback of <em>just that</em>. Later I learned more vocabularies in programming: patterns, modules... I have finally found the precise words to describe that moment of epiphany.

		<p>You do seem happy about it.</p>

		<p>Yes. Yes, I am. It is deeply satifying to see the connections between different disciplines -- and to be able to get very good at something you thought you never would. I love metaphors. Data structure, building structure. Binding data to a node, associating meaning with a name. It's all very philosophical. It's almost as if you were learning a new language AND doing stand-up comedy in it, and people laugh because your wit is real despite your mother tongue. Of course I've endured the boring, the stressful, the demanding -- times of production. On those days it feels like working on a construction drawing of a condo that you didn't design.
		<p class="direction">(unrolls tracing paper of old drawings)</p>
		Ironic, isn't it. The parallel of the production process in all fields.
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		And I've been blocked, many many times, by concepts and new knowledge that were too much to swallow. I've made a fool of myself by blowing the scope -- that's today's speak of "you fucked up the budget". I took on more than what I could chew. But I learn. I learn in the end.
