		<p>I am a technologist...Yes, that's a term. It's vague, and whenever I use the word people follow up by asking, "so what does that mean." Usually I just simplify it and say I teach journalists how to code.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>I thought simplification bugged you. You are proud of the liberal arts way of defining things.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Yes, I call it the fluffy way. But nuanced discussions are not always immediately available. Many conversations are 10 seconds long and dead.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>You think you are being labeled and so you don't bother to explain.</p>

	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Exactly.</p>

		<p>Ain't a good attitude.</p>

		<p class="direction">(takes in the words)</p>
		<p>You are right. My defense mechanism in a world filled with pre-judgements, impatience, and small talks is contributing to the very problem.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>You know what's funny though? When I wanted to be an architect a few years ago, I was told -- by my mentors, by the books, by the idols I had at the time -- to LIVE, and do so with tremedous humility.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>An architect is the very profession of empathy.</p>
		<p class="direction">(finds it profound, yet funny)</p>
		<p>Now I have empathized with computers.</p>

	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>And that's a metaphor for?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>The fact that I am more rational and efficient and, to some extent, desensitized. I've become very pragmatic and refuse to call myself an artist.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Well first of all, what you described is called growth... Second, what's wrong with calling yourself an artist?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>You make things for yourself. And that's selfish.</p>

		<p>An artist can be as selfless or narcissistic as she wants to be.</p>

		<p>Yes. Yes... But that was the period where I...</p>
		<p class="direction">(pulls out a sketchbook from the bookshelf and flips to a page)</p>
		<p>I had this epiphany once. I was at an architecture critique with all the guests. One of my studio mates was presenting, but I was so deep in thought with my own project. My brain was filled with words and images and sketches... but all of a sudden -- beyond the control of my consciousness -- they started to zoom out, like a camera that was very close started to pull away, away...and away...until all those letters and drawings became a square. One. Single. Square. Dense with information, yet unintelligible. The camera moved on to a different block of words and images, close up, and the same thing happened -- away...away...and away! </p>
		<p class="direction">(points to a place on the page)</p>
		I ended up with all these neatly organized squares. It was the <em>definition of patterns</em>. Patterns! I remember thinking, is this what abstraction is? Is this how my brain organizes chaos? Is it, actually, how the human mind works??? 
		<p class="direction">(more calmly)</p>
		The first time I organized a bunch of code into objects I had a flashback of <em>just that</em>. Later I learned more vocabularies in programming: patterns, in the programming sense, modules... I have finally found the precise words to describe that moment of epiphany.

		<p>Now <em>that's</em> what you should say when people ask you what a technologist means.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Ha. If I could get them to listen for more than 10 seconds, I guess.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>But yeah, it is deeply satifying to see the connections between different disciplines -- and to be able to get very good at something you thought you never would. I love metaphors. Data structure, building structure. Binding data to a node, associating meaning with a name. It's all very philosophical. It's almost as if you were learning a new language AND doing stand-up comedy in it, and people laugh because your wit is real despite your mother tongue. Of course I've endured the boring, the stressful, the demanding -- times of production. On those days it feels like working on a construction drawing of a condo that you didn't design.
		<p class="direction">(unrolls tracing paper of old drawings)</p>
		<p>Ironic, isn't it. The production process across all fields.</p>
		<p class="direction">(beat)</p>
		<p>And I've been blocked, many many times, by concepts and new knowledge that were too much to swallow. I've made a fool of myself by blowing the scope -- that's today's speak of "you fucked up the budget". I took on more than what I could chew. But I learn. I learn in the end.</p>

		<p>So you <em>have</em> lived with humility, to some degree at least. You have learned valuable lessons, practicality being one of them, and you ar...</p>

		<p>What are you doing?</p>

	<div class="direction">
		Playwright continues, and gathers a pile of artifacts, including: a cardboard architecture model, the unrolled tracing paper, a few colorful maps, a keyboard, a sleek monitor.

	<div class="dialogue">
		<p class="direction">(picks up the monitor and uses it as a mirror)</p>
		<p>Huh. My left side is better-looking.</p>

		<p class="direction">(regarding the pile)</p>
		<p>I think I have a new pattern here.</p>

		<p>Is that why you invited me? To check out your new pattern?</p>
