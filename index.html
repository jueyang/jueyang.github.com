	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Yes. It's vague, I know. Whenever I use the term people ask, "so what does that mean?" Usually I just simplify it and say I teach journalists how to code.</p>

	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>I thought simplification bugged you. Did't you like the liberal arts way of defining things?</p>

	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Still do. The fluffy way. But nuanced discussions are not always immediately available. Most people are looking for elevator pitches.  They ask, "what do you do?", assess you for 10 seconds, and move on.</p>

		<p>When I wanted to be an <a href='http://oldwork.tumblr.com' target='_blank'>architect</a> a few years ago, I was told -- by my mentors, by the books, by the idols I had at the time -- to LIVE, and do so with tremedous humility. An architect is the very profession of empathy.</p>
		<p class="direction">(finds it profound, yet funny)</p>
		<p>So I lived and lived and now I have empathized with computers.</p>

		<p><a href="/portfolio" target="_blank">I made websites, constructed information architecture, geo-located ideas and patterns</a>. I let the unforeseen opportunities shape my trajectory. I didn't want to preordain my experiences. But then... nothing was tangible but the keyboard, nothing was visible but the glowing screen. I kept going because I believed whatever knowledge I gained -- however irrelavant they seemed -- would add up to something. SOMETHING.</p>

	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>I don't know. You make things from your own ideas and you are usually protective of what you created. You don't think about the <em>real</em> world -- the business of living. You romanticize being broke. </p>

	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>An artist can be as selfless or narcissistic as she wants to. She can collaborate with as many or as few people, and have as much or as little social impact. She can certainly understand the, "real", world -- probably deeper than a lot of people. An artist can figure out ways to stay afloat... More than afloat. Sure, it might not be easy and might take more time than other paths. But an artist <em>does</em> because she <em>must</em>.</p>

		No answer. Playwright stays silent. She walks over to the bookshelf and examines the collection.

	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p class="direction">(as she looks for something on the bookshelf)</p>
		<p>It's the desire to dedicate myself while I am doing something totally different. The pursuit of craft. It's far and daunting and I don't know what is the right thing to do. I don't know how to be in two realities at the same time.</p>

		<p>But here you are setting up an arbituary binary for yourself -- artist or not artist. You pine for something. You tiptoe around it. And you begrudge others the work they've created.</p>

		<p class="direction">(pulls out a sketchbook from the bookshelf and flips to a page)</p>
		<p>I had this epiphany once. I was at an architecture critique. One of my studio mates was presenting, but I couldn't process what he was talking about at all. My brain was filled with words and images and sketches... I was deep, deep in thought, and all of a sudden -- beyond the control of my consciousness -- they started to zoom out, like a camera that was very close started to pull away. Away and away until all those letters and drawings became a square. One. Single. Square. Dense with information. Yet unintelligible. The camera moved on to a different block of words and images, close up at first, and the same thing happened -- away...away...and away! </p>
		<p class="direction">(points to a place on the page)</p>
		<p>I ended up with all these neatly organized squares. It was the <em>definition</em> of synthesis. I remember thinking, is this what abstraction is? Is this how my brain organizes chaos? Is this, actually, how the human mind works???</p>
		<p class="direction">(more calmly)</p>
		<p>I thought by living -- by learning things that I would not have dreamed of being capable of -- I would endure the chaos and reach that level of clarity again, with even more materials.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Have you?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>The first time I organized a bunch of code into objects (a programming paradigm) I had a flashback of <em>just that</em>: the camera zooming out. The synthesis. Later I learned more vocabularies in programming: functions, patterns, modules... I have finally found the precise words to describe that moment of epiphany. My metaphors expanded: data structure, building structure; binding data to a node, associating meaning with a name. I was able to understand both worlds. And I was able to decode and encrypt at the same time. It felt as though I was learning a new language and doing standup in it. And People laugh because I have the wit, the real deal, even though it's not my mother tongue.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Well, wit is a good thing --</p>

		<p>I love hearing people laugh.</p>

	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>-- but you are losing your mother tongue.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p class="direction">(takes in the words)</p>
		<p>It's too selfish to stay with what you know. It's too comfortable.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>Selfish to whom? Comfortable to whom?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="character">Playwright</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>I don't want to deprive myself from learning. I have earned these metaphors for my life because I have experienced the unfamliar. 
	</div>
	<div class="character">God</div>
	<div class="dialogue">
		<p>But you keep calling them metaphors! What are metaphors good for? They allude to something that's not the thing itself. What's the thing itself of your life??</p>
		<p class="direction">(throws playwright a pen)</p>
		<p>What is it? Tell the truth.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="direction">
		A long pause. Playwright picks up the pen, hesitates, then draws on the sketchbook. One single square.
